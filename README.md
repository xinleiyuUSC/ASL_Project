Deep Learning for American Sign Language (ASL) recognition has gained significant attention in recent years, with researchers using various datasets available on Kaggle to develop innovative models. The dataset linked above contains images from 29 classes (26 alphabets, SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING). Each class contains 3000 images in the training set and each image is a 200 x 200 RGB image This dataset is instrumental in training deep learning models to automatically recognize and translate ASL gestures into text or speech, thus improving communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

In deep learning, convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as the leading approach in developing such models due to their ability to efficiently process and analyze visual data.
